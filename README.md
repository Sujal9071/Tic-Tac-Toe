# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java Project
The tic-tac-toe game is for two players.
One player plays X and the other player plays 0. The players take turns placing their marks
on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally then that player wins the game.
This game is made by using Java.
